## üëã Hi there 

My name is Natali. I'm a frontend developer with a real passion for building attractive and complex interfaces. I do love creating modern visual effects and have built some popular snippets on CodePen (check them out below).

Additionally, I'm a beginner tech article writer. I'm interested in sharing my experience through helpful articles and tutorials.

## üíª My UI/UX Projects
### All the items are realizations of my ideas, fully hand-built by me from the design up to code implementation
#### (TS/JS/HTML/CSS)

| Project Repo | Demo | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [Notifications Collection](https://github.com/nat-davydova/notifications-collection) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/QWQvJjB) | A set of 4 HTML/CSS notification concepts (success/warning/danger). I've built them to share with junior frontend developers to encourage them to use notifications in their pet projects for better UI/UX. Inspired by some Dribbble shots. Fully responsive. |
| [Fancy Navigation Block](https://github.com/nat-davydova/fancy-navigation-block) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/zYPBRbm) | A fancy main page concept with multiple tiles sharing a single background image that beautifully changes on tile hover. Each tile is clickable and reveals corresponding inner page content. Fully responsive.|
| ['Load More' Concept](https://github.com/nat-davydova/load-more-concept) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/XWKxJyd) | A 'load more' concept is useful when users have a lengthy list of items and want to show them in parts: making more elements visible on 'Load More' button click. I've integrated Animate.css in this project, so users can choose from a long list of predefined animations. |
| [Password Strength Validator UI](https://github.com/nat-davydova/password-strength) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/yLyXogO) | Bootstrap-compatible password strength validation UI/UX. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how smooth and slick such an effect can be. |
| [Multi Step Form with animations](https://github.com/nat-davydova/multisteps-form) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/PoYXZxg) | Bootstrap-compatible multi-step form where users can choose from 1 of 5 predefined, hand-built step reveal animations. Fully responsive. |
| [Submit buttons inspiration](https://github.com/nat-davydova/submit-buttons) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/pozRMrx) | A CSS3/JS animations experiment: an appealing submit button concept. When users click on them, they will first see a loading animation, followed by a successful submission animation. |
| [Timeline Inspiration](https://github.com/nat-davydova/timeline) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/xxKOdvv) | Material UI-compatible timeline inspiration. Can be useful to present a schedule of different events. Users can set the position for each timeline item. Additionally, there is an intricate gradient effect. Fully responsive. |
| [Tabs Navigation UI](https://github.com/nat-davydova/tab-navigation) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/PMJJRM) | Material UI-compatible tabs animation: animates both tab pill changes and tab content changes. |
| [Gradient Navigation Tiles](https://github.com/nat-davydova/gradient-navigation) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/mNOMBV) | Navigation Inspiration with separate tiles sharing a single gradient image. Users can set their own gradient image and direction. The gradient will be recalculated based on the number of navigation tiles present. Fully responsive. |
