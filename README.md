## üëã Hi there 

My name is Natali. I'm a frontend developer with a real passion for building attractive and complex interfaces. I do love creating modern visual effects and have built some popular snippets on CodePen (check them out below).

Additionally, I'm a beginner tech article writer. I'm interested in sharing my experience through helpful articles and tutorials.

## ‚úèÔ∏è My Articles

| Article | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Hand-built smoothScrollTo() Implementation (Eng)](https://dev.to/nat_davydova/hand-built-smoothscrollto-implementation-3383) | This article is a summary of my implementation of a vanilla JS alternative to the browser's `scroll-behavior: smooth` feature, along with a step-by-step tutorial on one of the possible implementation variants. |
| [Function Overloadings in Typescript (Ru)](https://medium.com/@natti.davydova/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D1%84%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B2-typescript-74c0968cae51) | This article was born from experiments with function overloading in TypeScript. After an introduction about what overloading is in general, I want to talk about the curious nuances I encountered, and how these nuances have changed my understanding of working with overloads |

## üì• My In-depth Projects
### The purpose of these projects is to explore certain concepts in-depth and, optionally, to share the exploration results as a tutorial or article.

| Project Repo | Demo | Article |  Stack | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| [smoothScrollTo() Function Concept](https://github.com/nat-davydova/smoothScrollTo-concept) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/QWZwOdb/5db409195086b5b1631055fbcb6c94e5) | [Article](https://dev.to/nat_davydova/hand-built-smoothscrollto-implementation-3383) |  TS/JS/HTML/CSS | I'm implementing my own vanilla JS alternative to the browser's `scroll-behavior: smooth` feature here. It's useful for cases when you need to combine this functionality with complex scroll JS behavior. Also I've experimented with RAFs here. |

## üíª My UI/UX Open-source Projects
### All the items are realizations of my ideas, fully hand-built by me from the design up to code implementation
#### (TS/JS/HTML/CSS)

Each tile is clickable and reveals corresponding inner page content. Fully responsive.|
| ['Load More' Concept](https://github.com/nat-davydova/load-more-concept) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/XWKxJyd) | A 'load more' concept is useful when users have a lengthy list of items and want to show them in parts: making more elements visible on 'Load More' button click. I've integrated Animate.css in this project, so users can choose from a long list of predefined animations. |
| [Password Strength Validator UI](https://github.com/nat-davydova/password-strength) | [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/nat-davydova/full/yLyXogO) | Bootstrap-compatible password strength validation UI/UX. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how smooth and slick such an effect can be. |
