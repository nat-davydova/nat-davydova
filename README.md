## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natali. I'm a frontend developer with a real passion for building attractive and complex interfaces. I do love creating modern visual effects and have built some popular snippets on CodePen (check them out below).

Additionally, I'm a beginner tech article writer. I'm interested in sharing my experience through helpful articles and tutorials.
